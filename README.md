This project is part of the 2nd course 'Data Structures and Performance' out of the 5 course specialization in 'Object Oriented Java Programming: Data Structures and Beyond' Course taken on Coursera which is taught by UC San Diego. After completing the first course of this specialization, it really cleared my doubts and concepts about object oriented programming and I also enjoyed making my own custom geospatial map during the course. So after that, I was very keen to continue this course and although I knew a bit about data structures, I wanted to learn it inside out with the performance parameters. So I enrolled in the 2nd course and this too has a great project, and since it involves data structures it's going to be more of the back-end development rather than front end which I prefer as I like to develop logic and solve problems. This will also help me to really dig in and experiment with the different data structures that I'm learning and the running times for each of them.

Learning outcomes:

1.Write code to manipulate text in Java

2.Use appropriate built-in data structures to implement functionality

3.Implement a specified Interface

4.Perform benchmarking to measure running time of code

5.Relate results of benchmarking tests to Big-O analysis

6.Write code to implement several core data structures

7.Write unit tests using JUnit to ensure the correctness of code
